<h2>Hands-on 2: The UNIX Time-Sharing System</h2>

<p>
Complete the following hands-on assignment.  Do the activities
described, and submit your solutions using the <a
href="https://6033.scripts.mit.edu:444/submit.cgi">online submission site</a>
by 11:59p.
This assignment is longer than the DNS one.

Before attempting this hands-on, you
should read <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/papers/indirect-unix.shtml">The Unix
Time-Sharing System</a>, which is also assigned for this recitation.
You might also find Section 2.5 of the book useful for questions 8-19.
</p>


<h4>I. Warmup</h4>

<p>Log into an Athena machine.  (athena.dialup.mit.edu is ok) and get
access to the Athena command prompt.  If you logged into an Athena
dialup machine, you should see the prompt in your ssh client.  If you
logged into an Athena workstation you may need to open a terminal
window.  The prompt should look something like this (the "<tt>no-knife</tt>" part may say something different):

<blockquote><code>
  no-knife:~> <font color="green"></font>
</code></blockquote>

<p>Use the <tt>add</tt> command to gain access to the 6.033 utilities
you will use in this assignment.</p>

<blockquote><code>
  no-knife:~> <font color="green">add 6.033</font>
</code></blockquote>

<p>Some of the directions in this hands-on assume your UNIX shell is
<tt>tcsh</tt>.  Run the
following command to ensure you're running the appropriate shell.
After you run "tcsh -f" your prompt will change to a single "<tt>></tt>".</p>

<blockquote><code>
  no-knife:~> <font color="green">tcsh -f</font>
</code></blockquote>

<p>
We'll start off with an extremely simple example that most of you are
probably familiar with already:

</p><blockquote>
<code>
   athena% <strong>cd /bin</strong> <br>
   athena% <strong>ls -1 | more</strong> <br>
</code>
</blockquote>

Here, we are first changing into the /bin directory, which contains
many of the executable commands for the system. The command <code>ls
-1</code> gives us a listing of all the files in the current directory
with one file per line. (Note that <code>-1</code> is the numeral
"one", not the letter "L".) We then pipe the output from
<code>ls</code> to the command <code>more</code>, which displays the
results one page at a time. (Press the space bar to show the next
page.) You can refer to the manual pages for <code>ls</code> and
<code>more</code> to see more details and options for each
command. Manual pages let you read information about various commands
on UNIX systems; to use them, run

<blockquote>
<code>
   athena% <strong>man <i>command</i></strong> <br>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
where <code><i>command</i></code> is the command you are interested
in. If you are unfamiliar with manual pages, you may want to try
running

</p><blockquote>
<code>
    athena% <strong>man man</strong> <br>
</code>
</blockquote>

for information on the man command itself.  Keep in mind that the
manual pages for basic commands vary from system to system (much as
the commands themselves do).
<p></p>

<p>
Now, try this:

</p><blockquote>
<code>
   athena% <strong>cd /bin</strong> <br>
   athena% <strong>ls -1 | grep p | more</strong> <br>
</code>
</blockquote>

This runs the same <code>ls -1</code> command, but only lists the
executable files which happen to contain the letter "p" somewhere in
their names.
<p></p>

<p>
The point here is to observe that you can chain together multiple
commands using the pipe character ( | ), and the output from each
command will be passed to the input of the next, in left-to-right
order. This allows you to treat any command that uses standard input
and output as a primitive from which you can build more complex and
useful commands.
</p>


<h4>II. Building Blocks</h4>

<p>
Now, we'd like you to figure out on your own how to solve some
problems by chaining different commands together.
</p>

<p>
If you aren't already familiar with these commands, you may want to
briefly skim through their man pages to familiarize yourself with what
they do. You will probably need to use some of the options for the
different commands in order to solve these problems.
</p>

<p>
Here are the commands you may find useful:

<code>
</code></p><pre>cat
fmt
grep
head
ls
ps
sort 
tail
top
wc
yes (*)
</pre>


<p></p>

<p>
(*) On some Athena machines, the <code>yes</code> command isn't
available.  However, if you are doing this assignment on Athena you
can use the command <code>gyes</code>, which is functionally
equivalent. <code>gyes</code> is located in the "gnu" locker, so
before you can use it you need to add the locker. You can do so with
the following command:

</p><blockquote>
<code>
  athena% <strong>add gnu</strong> <br>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>
(If you are curious about Athena's locker system, you can run
<code>man lockers</code> for more information.  The command
<code>whichlocker</code> can be used to determine which locker
contains a given command.  The <code>whichlocker</code> command itself
resides in the "outland" locker. For more info on other lockers, look at 
this <a href="http://www.mit.edu/%7Easksipb/2004columns/2004-09-03-lockers/">SIPB article</a>)
</p>

<p>
Once you have added the gnu locker, you can use <code>gyes</code>
instead of <code>yes</code>. Some Athena machines seem to lack the
manual pages for both <code>yes</code> and <code>gyes</code>
(hereafter referred to just as <code>yes</code>). In case the man
pages are missing on the machine you are using, here is a brief
description of what <code>yes</code> does. <code>yes</code> is very
simple; it just outputs a string repeatedly until killed. It takes
either one or zero arguments; if you give it a string as an argument
it will output that string until it is killed (you can kill a process by
pressing control-c). If you give it no
arguments, it will output the string "y" until it is killed, which
explains why it is named <code>yes</code>.
</p>


<h4>Pipe questions</h4>

<p>
For each of the outputs listed below, find one sequence of commands
connected by pipes that produces the output. For each problem, turn in
the command sequence that you used to generate the requested
output. (Do NOT turn in the output itself.)
</p>

<p><b>Question 1:</b>
A listing of all processes that <i>you</i> are currently running on
the Athena machine you are using, sorted by the command name in
alphabetical order (i.e. a process running <code>acroread</code>
should be listed before a process running <code>zwgc</code>). The
output should consist <i>only</i> of the processes you are running,
and nothing else (i.e. if you are running 6 processes, the output
should only have 6 lines).  <br> </li>

<p><b>Question 2:</b>
The number of words in the file
<code><strong>/usr/share/dict/words</strong></code> (*) which do not contain any of
the letters a, e, i, o, or u.
<p>
[* Note: On some Unix/Linux systems, the dictionary has the filename <strong>/usr/dict/words</strong>]<br>


<p><b>Question 3:</b>
A <code>5x6</code> matrix of entries of alternating <code>1's</code> and <code>0's</code>.  It should look like this:
<pre>1 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 0
</pre>
<br>
</li>

<p><b>Question 4:</b>
A "long" listing of the smallest 5 files in the
<code><strong>/etc</strong></code> directory whose name contains
the string ".conf", sorted by <i>increasing</i> file size.
<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now we'd like to explore something slightly different, having to do
with file redirection as discussed in section 6.2-6.4 of the
paper. The authors explain that the following two commands are
functionally equivalent (except that you have to remove the temp file
afterwards in the second case):

</p><blockquote>
<code>
  athena% <strong>ls | head -1</strong> <br>
  athena% <strong>ls &gt; temp; head -1 &lt; temp</strong> <br>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

  <p><b>Question 5:</b>

Try the above commands in a few different directories.  What happens if you
try both of the commands in the <strong>/etc</strong> directory on athena?  
How else can the second command not produce the same output as the first?  
Can you think of any negative side effects that the second construction might
cause for the user?  You might want to think about the commands you
used to solve the first four questions and consider their behavior.


<p>
The UNIX paper authors explain in section 6.3 that a user can type two
commands together in parenthesis separated by a semicolon, and
redirect the output to a file. The file will then contain the
concatenation of the two commands. The example from the paper is
roughly:

</p><blockquote>
<code>
   athena% <strong>(date ; ls) &gt; temp1 &amp;</strong> <br>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>
Note that this example uses the &amp; operator to run the process
asynchronously.  That is, the shell will accept and run another
command without waiting for the first to finish.  The authors also
mention that one can use the &amp; operator multiple times on one
line. For example, we can do almost the same thing:

</p><blockquote>
<code>
   athena% <strong>(date &amp; ls) &gt; temp2 &amp;</strong> <br>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>
See if you can figure out for yourself what exactly the difference is
between using ";" and "&amp;" in the examples above.
</p>

<p>
Let's explore this for ourselves. First, we will write a very simple
variation on the "yes" program that you encountered earlier on in this
assignment. To do so, we will use the "command file" functionality
described in section 6.4 of the paper. Most people call these command
files "shell scripts", since they are essentially simple scripts that
are executed by the shell.
</p>

<p>
First, start up a copy of emacs editing a new file called "myyes".

</p><blockquote>
<code>
   athena% <strong>emacs myyes</strong> <br>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>
Now, enter the following lines into your file:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>#!/bin/sh

echo y
sleep 1
echo n
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>
Save the file and exit emacs. If you don't already know what the
<code>echo</code> and <code>sleep</code> commands do, look them up in
the man pages. Lastly, make the file executable by running the
following command:

</p><blockquote>
<code>
   athena% <strong>chmod a+rx myyes</strong> <br>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>
Now let's try running the following two commands:

</p><blockquote>
<code>
  athena% <strong>(./myyes ;     ./myyes) &gt; temp3</strong> <br>
  athena% <strong>(./myyes &amp; ./myyes) &gt; temp4</strong> <br>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="-1"><em>Note:
Some fast multicore machines may occasionally give unexpected answers, where
some output is lost - originally unexpected even to the 6.033 staff. If this
occurs for you on your home machine, you may want to think briefly about why
this occurs.</em></font></p>

<p><b>Question 6:</b>
Compare the two temp files. Based on your understanding of
file I/O in UNIX, what is going on here, and why?  Is this different
from what you would expect? (If there is more than one difference
between the two files, it is the ordering of the letters y and n that
we are interested in).
<br>

<p><b>Question 7:</b>
The paper describes the Unix system call interface in some
detail.  In particular, the <tt>read</tt> and <tt>write</tt> system
calls do not take the offset as an argument.  Why did the Unix
designers not include the offset as an argument to <tt>read</tt>
and <tt>write</tt>?  How would an application write to a specific
offset in a file?

<h4>Looking Around</h4>

<p>When you log in, the system sets your <i>current working directory</i> to
your <i>home directory</i>, your personal name space where you can create your
own files, directories and links.  You can view the contents of your current
working directory with the <tt>ls</tt> command (see above). Use the <tt>pwd</tt>
command to learn the <i>absolute path</i> of your current working directory.
This will tell you where you are in the directory name space even if you move
around in the directories.</p>

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">pwd</font>
</code></blockquote>

The output of <tt>pwd</tt> reveals where the Athena administrators
store your home directory.  For example,
<tt>/afs/athena.mit.edu/user</tt> tells us that the your home
directory is stored as a user in the Athena name space.

<p>The <tt>stat</tt> program reports detailed information about
a file including its inode number, link count, file type
and other metadata.  To use it, type <tt>stat</tt> followed by a file
name at the command prompt.  Run <tt>stat</tt> on your home
directory:</p>

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">stat .</font>
</code></blockquote>



<h4>III. Creating Directories and Files</h4>

<p>Now create a directory named <tt>6.033-handson2</tt> in your home
directory using the <tt>mkdir</tt> command.  You
can learn more about the <tt>mkdir</tt> command with <tt>man mkdir</tt>.

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">mkdir 6.033-handson2</font>
</code></blockquote>

<p>Use <tt>ls</tt> to verify that the new directory exists.  Now
change your current working directory to your new
<tt>6.033-handson2</tt> directory using the <tt>cd</tt> command and
verify that your working directory has changed using <tt>pwd</tt>.</p>

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">cd 6.033-handson2</font><br>
  > <font color="green">pwd</font>
</code></blockquote>

View the contents of your new directory using <tt>ls -a -l</tt>.
<tt>ls</tt> normally hides the directories "." and "..", but the
<tt>-a</tt> option forces it to show them.

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">ls -a -l</font>
</code></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 8:</b> Change to the '.' entry in your new directory.
What happens to your working directory?  Next, change to the '..'
entry.  What happens to your working directory?</p>

<p><b>Question 9:</b> Describe a scenario where you might need to use
the '.' directory.
</blockquote>


<p>Change your current directory back to your new
<tt>6.033-handson2</tt> directory and stat the current directory; note
the link count.  Now create a couple files in your new directory
using the <tt>touch</tt> command and stat the directory again.</p>

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">stat .</font><br>
  > <font color="green">touch foo bar</font><br>
  > <font color="green">ls</font><br>
  > <font color="green">stat .</font>
</code></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 10:</b> What has changed in the stat output and why has
it changed?
</blockquote>

<p>Now create a subdirectory <tt>baz</tt> in <tt>6.033-handson2</tt>
and stat the directory once more.</p>

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">mkdir baz</font><br>
  > <font color="green">stat .</font>
</code></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 11:</b> What has changed in the stat output this time
and why has it changed?  Why does the link count only change when
you create a new directory?
</blockquote>


<h4>IV. Creating Links</h4>

<p>The <tt>ln</tt> command can create both hard links and soft
(symbolic) links.  Read the man page for more information.

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">man ln</font><br>
</code></blockquote>

<p>First stat your file <tt>foo</tt> and read the output information.
Then create a hard-link named <tt>foo-lnk</tt> and stat both <tt>foo</tt>
and <tt>foo-lnk</tt>.</p>

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">stat foo</font><br>
  > <font color="green">ln foo foo-lnk</font><br>
  > <font color="green">stat foo</font><br>
  > <font color="green">stat foo-lnk</font><br>
</code></blockquote>

<p>Note that everything about <tt>foo</tt> and <tt>foo-lnk</tt> is
identical except for their names.  If you modify <tt>foo</tt>
you will see the modifications in <tt>foo-lnk</tt>.</p>

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">echo Hello >> foo</font><br>
  > <font color="green">cat foo-lnk</font><br>
</code></blockquote>


<p>Now create a symbolic link to <tt>foo</tt> and note that the
symbolic link differs from the original file in several ways.
Creating the symbolic link does not increase the link count of
<tt>foo</tt> and the symbolic link does not share an inode with
<tt>foo</tt>.</p>

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">stat foo</font><br>
  > <font color="green">ln -s foo foo-slnk</font><br>
  > <font color="green">stat foo</font><br>
  > <font color="green">stat foo-slnk</font><br>
</code></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 12:</b> One reason for supporting symbolic links is to
allow linking from one disk to another disk, but you can also create a
symbolic link to a file on the same disk.  Name one advantage and
one disadvantage of using symbolic links on the same disk.
</blockquote>


Now <tt>cd</tt> to the 6.033 Athena locker with the command:

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">cd /mit/6.033</font><br>
</code></blockquote>

Your home directory is accessible by the path <tt>/mit/YOUR_USERNAME</tt>
(replace YOUR_USERNAME with your username).  Try to change to your home
directory with the command:

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">cd ../YOUR_USERNAME</font><br>
</code></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 13:</b> What happened?  Why?
</blockquote>


Like your home directory, the 6.033 locker's absolute path is much
longer than <tt>/mit/6.033</tt> and <tt>/mit/6.033</tt> is only a
symbolic link.  You can learn the absolute path name by typing
<tt>pwd</tt> or by typing:

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">ls -l /mit</font><br>
</code></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 14:</b> You can reach the 6.033 locker with the path
<tt>/afs/athena.mit.edu/course/6/6.033</tt>.  Why does Athena
also provide the <tt>/mit/6.033</tt> symbolic link? </p>

<p><b>Question 15:</b> How would you change the file system to make
this command (<code><font color="green">cd /mit/6.033; cd ../YOUR_USERNAME</font></code>) actually change to your home directory? 

</blockquote>

<h4>V. The Search Path</h4>

The UNIX shell has a configuration variable named PATH that tells the
shell where to look in the file system for programs we type on the
command line.  You can see your PATH variable with this command:

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">echo $PATH</font><br>
</code></blockquote>


You can configure your shell to search the current working directory
by adding '.' to the PATH using these commands:

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">setenv OLDPATH $PATH</font><br>
  > <font color="green">setenv PATH .:$PATH</font><br>
</code></blockquote>

Now, cd to <tt>/mit/6.033</tt> and run our demo program using the 
following commands.  Your shell will find the "<tt>demo</tt>" program
because it is in your working directory.

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">cd /mit/6.033</font><br>
  > <font color="green">demo</font><br>
</code></blockquote>

Oh no, something terrible just happened!  Just kidding, the demo
program did not actually do anything.  Verify that nothing happened
with <tt>ls</tt>.

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">ls -l</font><br>
</code></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 16:</b> What happened to <tt>ls</tt>?  Why isn't it
listing files like it did before?  (Hint: set your path back to its
original state: <code><font color="green">setenv PATH $OLDPATH</font></code>)
</blockquote>

Usually, it is a bad idea of have '.' in your PATH, because it is easy
to run the wrong programs by accident.  Instead, you can use '.' explicitly
to run programs in your working directory like this:

<blockquote><code>
  > <font color="green">./demo</font><br>
</code></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 17:</b> How long did this assignment take you to
complete up to this point? </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>VI. Extra Credit</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 18:</b> Chapter 2.5 describes how (in UNIX) a file's
inode maps to the file's data blocks using direct pointers and
indirect blocks.  An alternative strategy, as used in FAT, stores a
file's data as a linked list of FAT entries, each corresponding to a block (<i>cluster</i>).  Name one
advantage and one disadvantage of the linked list strategy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 19:</b> Some shells like <tt>bash</tt> try to make '..' always
work properly, namely, <tt>cd /mit/6.033; cd ../$USER</tt> will place you in
your home directory.  Does <tt>bash</tt> always get this behavior correct?</p>
</blockquote>
