<p>
This hands-on exercise is designed to introduce you
to the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS).
You probably use DNS every day --- you used it
to get to this page.  To prepare for this assignment, please read
Section 4.4 of the class textbook, titled "Case study: The Internet
Domain Name System (DNS)", which is also signed for recitation section.
</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
  A good tool for exploring DNS is
  <code>dig</code>, short for Domain Information Groper.
  <code>dig</code> should be available on all recent
  Athena workstations.
<p>
Here is an example use of <code>dig</code>:

<p>
  <tt>dig</tt> performs a DNS lookup and prints information
  about the request and the response it received.
  If you run <tt>dig</tt>, you may see results that differ from those
  presented here.
  At the bottom, we can see that the query was
  sent to our default server (<code>127.0.0.1</code>), and that it
  took roughly 0 milliseconds to respond. Most of the information we are
  interested in is in the <code>ANSWER</code> section, marked with
  a <b><code>(*)</code></b> above. Let's examine
  that section more closely:

<pre>        ;; ANSWER SECTION:
        wikipedia.org.          572     IN      A       208.80.152.201      <b>(*)</b>
<i>          name                 expire  class   type     data (IP)</i>
</pre>

  We can see that this result is of type <code>A</code>, an address
  record: it is telling us that the IP address for the name
  "<code>wikipedia.org</code>" is <code>208.80.152.201</code>. The
  expiry time field "<code>572</code>" indicates that this
  record/entry is valid for 572 seconds (about five minutes). You can ignore the
  "class" field; this is nearly always <code>IN</code> for Internet.
<p>
  The <code>AUTHORITY</code> section contains records of type <code>NS</code>,
  indicating the names of DNS servers that have name records for a
  particular domain. Here, we can see that three DNS servers
  (<code>ns0.wikimedia.org.</code>, <code>ns1.wikimedia.org.</code>
  and <code>ns2.wikimedia.org.</code>) are responsible for
  answering requests for names in the <code>wikipedia.org</code>
  domain.
  
</p>
<p>
  We can ask a specific server (instead of the default) for information
  about a host by using the following syntax:
  
</p>
<pre>
adehnert@mint-square:~$ dig @bitsy.mit.edu wikipedia.org

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.7.0-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @bitsy.mit.edu wikipedia.org
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 24050
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 3, ADDITIONAL: 3

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;wikipedia.org.                 IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
wikipedia.org.          2853    IN      A       208.80.152.201

[output truncated]
</pre>

<p>
The <code>rd</code>
  (recursion desired) flag indicates that <code>dig</code> requested a recursive
  lookup, and the <code>ra</code> (recursion available) flag indicates
  that the server permits recursive lookups (some do not).

  <p> <code>dig</code> only prints the final result of the recursive search.
  You can mimic the individual steps of a recursive search 
  by sending a request to a particular DNS server and asking for no
  recursion, using
  the <code>+norecurs</code> flag.  For example, to send a
  non-recursive query to one of the root servers:
  
</p>
<pre>adehnert@mint-square:~$ dig @a.ROOT-SERVERS.NET www.wikipedia.org +norecurs

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.7.0-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @a.ROOT-SERVERS.NET www.wikipedia.org +norecurs

As you can see, the server does not know the answer and instead
provides information about the servers most likely to be able to
provide authoritative information. In this case, the best the root
server knows is the identities of the servers for
the <code>org.</code> domain.

<!-- <p>
  Here are some exercises.  This hands-on
  should be doable from any workstation that has <code>dig</code> or an equivalent
  command, but if you try it anywhere other than on an Athena
  workstation, and you run into something unexpected, the teaching
  staff may not be able to help you figure out what is going on. -->
<p>
Here are some exercises.
You should submit answers <em>only</em> to the
questions asked. In particular, please do not include pages of output
from <code>dig</code> unless specifically requested.  As usual, submit your solutions using the <a href="https://6033.scripts.mit.edu:444/submit.cgi">online submission site</a>, before recitation.

</p>
<h4>
  I. Getting started
</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
  <strong>(1)</strong> Using <code>dig</code>, find the IP address
  for <code>thyme.lcs.mit.edu</code>. What is the IP address?
<li>  <strong>(2)</strong> The <code>dig</code> answer for <code>thyme</code>
  includes a record of type <code>CNAME</code>.
  In the terminology of chapter 4, what does <code>CNAME</code> mean?
<li>  <strong>(3) </strong>What is the expiration time for 
the <tt>thyme</tt> <tt>CNAME</tt> record?
  <br>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Run these commands to find what the computer
you're using gets when it looks up "<tt>ai</tt>" and "<tt>ai.</tt>".
<pre>
dig +domain=mit.edu ai
dig +domain=mit.edu ai.
</pre>
What are the two resulting IP addresses?
<li>
  <strong>(5)</strong> Why are the results different? Look at the man
  page for dig to see what the +domain= parameter does.  Based on the
  output of the two commands, what is the difference between the
  DNS searches being performed for <code>ai</code>
  and <code>ai.</code>?
</ul>
</p>

<h4>
  II. Understanding hierarchy
</h4>
<p>
  For this problem, you will go through the steps of resolving a
  particular hostname, mimicing a standard recursive query.
  Assuming it knows nothing
  else about a name, a DNS resolver will ask a well-known <em>root
  server</em>. The root servers on the Internet are
  in the domain <code>root-servers.net</code>. One way to get a list
  of them is with the command:
</p>
<pre>athena% dig . ns
</pre>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
  <strong>(6)</strong> Use <code>dig</code> to ask <em>one</em> of the root servers the
  address of <code>lirone.csail.mit.edu</code>, <em>without</em>
  recursion. What command do you use to do this?
<li>
  <strong>(7) </strong>It is unlikely that these servers actually know
  the answer so they will <em>refer</em> you to a server (or list
  of servers) that might know more.  Go through the hierarchy from the
  root <b>without recursion</b>, following the referrals manually,
  until you have found the address
  of <code>lirone.csail.mit.edu</code>. What commands did you use to do this?
What IP address did you find for <tt>lirone</tt>?
<!--<li>
  <strong>(10) </strong>What is the record returned in the <code>ANSWER
  SECTION</code> of the final command?
<li>
  <strong>(11) </strong>How many iterations did it take to find the IP
  address? What commands did you use for each one? -->
</ul>
</p>
<h4>
  III. Understanding caching
</h4>
These queries will show you how your local machine's DNS cache works.
<ul>
  <li><strong>(8)</strong>
  Ask your default server for information, without recursion,
  about the host <code>www.dmoz.org</code>. What command did you use?
  Did your default server
  have the answer in its cache? How do you know? How long did
  this query take?  If this information was cached,
  please find some other host name that is not cached and do this
  section with that other host.
  
</li>
  <li> <strong>(9) </strong>Now, ask your default server this same
  query but <em>with</em> recursion. It should return an answer for you. How
  long did this take?
  
</li>
  <li><strong>(10) </strong>
  Finally, ask your default server again without recursion. How long
  does this request take? Has the cache served its purpose?
  
</li>
<!--  <li>
  <strong>(16) </strong>Watch the expiration time decrement on the
  cache by repeating the previous step. If you wait long enough, you can
  watch it return to the original state and then you can repeat this
  cycle. A good host to play with for this might be
  <code>ad.doubleclick.net</code>. If you look at this, do you notice
  anything else interesting about the responses that you get back?£
  </li>
-->
</ul>
