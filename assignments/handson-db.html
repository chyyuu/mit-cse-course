<h1>
Hands-on 8: Databases
</h1>

<p>
This hands-on assignment will introduce you to databases and transactions.
Many applications store data in a database similar to the one you will be
using in this exercise.  For example, it is common for web applications
to store data in an SQL database, such as MySQL or Postgres, and in this
hands-on, we will be using Postgres in particular.  One of the benefits
of using a database is that it can provide serializability and durability
guarantees that an ordinary file system does not.

<p>
Once you are done with this hands-on assignment, submit your answers,
along with the commands you ran and the output you got, using the <a
href="https://6033.scripts.mit.edu:444/submit.cgi">online submission
site</a> before 11:59p.

<h2>Intro to databases</h2> 

<p>
For the purposes of this exercise, we have set up a Postgres database
server on the machine <tt>ud0.csail.mit.edu</tt>.  We have created an
account for every student registered for 6.033 this term; check the online
submission web site for a short text file (under the database hands-on
assignment) that contains your username and password.  Please use our
Postgres server for this hands-on assignment, rather than some other
Postgres server, since we made some changes to defaults on our server.
In particular, we changed the default transaction isolation level for
all user accounts to <tt>SERIALIZABLE</tt>.

<p>
You can access your database by running the following
commands on a Linux-based Athena workstation or dialup.
To find your assigned username and password, check the <a
href="https://6033.scripts.mit.edu:444/submit.cgi">online submission
site</a> for a comment under the database hands-on assignment.

<blockquote><pre>
athena% <b>psql -h ud0.csail.mit.edu -U <i>username</i></b>
Password for user username: <b><i>password</i></b>
psql (8.4.10)
SSL connection (cipher: DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA, bits: 256)
Type "help" for help.

username=&gt; 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The <tt>psql</tt> command allows you to issue SQL queries to the database.
To exit from this shell, type <tt>\q</tt>.

<p>
SQL databases allow users (such as application developers) to organize
data in <i>tables</i>.  Each table consists of record called <i>rows</i>.
Each row, in turn, consists of several attributes called <i>columns</i>.
All rows in the table share the same set of columns, and these columns
must be defined ahead of time by the user when the table is created.

<p>
As an example, MIT's TechCash system, which handles payments using MIT ID
cards, might construct a table that stores information about accounts,
such as the account holder's Athena username, their full name, and the
total amount of money in their account.  You can visualize the table as
containing the following information, with 4 rows and 3 columns:

<p>
<blockquote>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>username</th>
    <th>fullname</th>
    <th>balance</th></tr>
<tr><td>jones</td>
    <td>Alice Jones</td>
    <td>82</td></tr>
<tr><td>bitdiddl</td>
    <td>Ben Bitdiddle</td>
    <td>65</td></tr>
<tr><td>mike</td>
    <td>Michael Dole</td>
    <td>73</td></tr>
<tr><td>alyssa</td>
    <td>Alyssa P. Hacker</td>
    <td>79</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this hands-on, you will use the SQL language to issue queries to
the database to perform operations on tables.  Postgres has a good <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/tutorial-sql.html">tutorial
on SQL</a>, as well as a more detailed <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/sql.html">SQL language
manual</a> that you can refer to.

<h2>Using SQL</h2>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.</b>

As a first step, use the SQL <tt>CREATE</tt> command to create the table shown above,
and then execute several <tt>INSERT</tt> commands to insert each of the rows
into the resulting table, as follows:

<p>
<blockquote><pre>
username=&gt; <b>create table accounts (username varchar(8), fullname varchar(128), balance int);</b>
CREATE TABLE
username=&gt; <b>insert into accounts values ('jones', 'Alice Jones', 82);</b>
INSERT 0 1
...
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you make a mistake, you can delete the <tt>accounts</tt> table by
issuing a <tt>DROP TABLE accounts;</tt> command, and then starting over.

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.</b>

Now, examine the table using the special <tt>\d</tt> command:

<p>
<blockquote><pre>
username=&gt; <b>\d accounts</b>
            Table "public.accounts"
  Column  |          Type          | Modifiers 
----------+------------------------+-----------
 username | character varying(8)   | 
 fullname | character varying(128) | 
 balance  | integer                | 

username=&gt; 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
We can now read data from the table using the <tt>SELECT</tt> command.
The <tt>SELECT</tt> command allows you to choose which rows to select
(by specifying a predicate in a <tt>WHERE</tt> clause), and what data
to return from each row (e.g., individual columns or aggregates such
as <tt>SUM()</tt>):

<p>
<blockquote><pre>
username=&gt; <b>select username, fullname, balance from accounts;</b>
...
username=&gt; <b>select fullname from accounts where balance > 75;</b>
...
username=&gt; <b>select sum(balance) from accounts;</b>
...
username=&gt; 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>Exercise 3.</b>

Run the above three commands.  Also construct and run a command to
display the full name of the person with username <tt>bitdiddl</tt>.
Also construct and run a command to display the average account balance
of people that have at least $70 in their account.  You may want to
refer to the <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/sql.html">Postgres SQL
manual</a> to find a suitable function for computing the average.

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.</b>

Transfer $10 from <tt>jones</tt> to <tt>mike</tt>.  You will
find the <tt>UPDATE</tt> command useful; consult the <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/sql.html">Postgres SQL
manual</a> for more details.  For this exercise, it will suffice to
perform two updates: one to deduct $10 from Alice's balance, and another
to add $10 to Michael's balance.

<h2>Transactions</h2>

<p>
To deal with concurrent operations, many SQL databases, including
Postgres, support transactions, which allow several SQL statements to
execute atomically (often meaning both <i>before-or-after atomicity</i>
and <i>all-or-nothing atomicity</i>).  To execute statements as a single
transaction, SQL clients first issue a <tt>BEGIN</tt> command, then
execute some SQL commands, and finally issue either a <tt>COMMIT</tt>
command, which makes the transaction's changes permanent, or a
<tt>ROLLBACK</tt> command, which reverts the changes from all of the
commands in the transaction.

<p>
In this assignment, you will simulate concurrent database queries
by issuing SQL statements over two different connections to the
database.  Open up two terminals, and run <tt>psql</tt> in each
of them, to create two connections to the database.  We will use
two colors (<span class="one">blue</span> and
<span class="two">red</span>) to indicate the two
database sessions.

<p>
Start a transaction in the first (blue) terminal, and display a list
of all accounts:

<blockquote><pre class="one">
username=&gt; <b>begin;</b>
BEGIN
username=&gt; <b>select * from accounts;</b>
 username |     fullname     | balance 
----------+------------------+---------
 bitdiddl | Ben Bitdiddle    |      65
 alyssa   | Alyssa P. Hacker |      79
 jones    | Alice Jones      |      72
 mike     | Michael Dole     |      83
(4 rows)

username=&gt; 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now, in the second (red) terminal, also start a transaction and
add an account for Chuck:

<blockquote><pre class="two">
username=&gt; <b>begin;</b>
BEGIN
username=&gt; <b>insert into accounts values ('chuck', 'Charles Robinson', 55);</b>
INSERT 0 1
username=&gt; 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>Exercise 5.</b>

Generate a list of all accounts in the first (blue) terminal, and in the second
(red) terminal.  What output do you get?  Are they the same or not?  Why?

<p>
Now, commit the transaction in the second (red) terminal, by issuing the
<tt>COMMIT</tt> statement:

<blockquote><pre class="two">
username=&gt; <b>commit;</b>
COMMIT
username=&gt; 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>Exercise 6.</b>

Generate a list of all accounts from the first (blue) terminal again.  Does
it include Chuck?  Why or why not?

<p>
<b>Exercise 7.</b>

Commit the transaction in the first (blue) terminal, start a new transaction,
and generate a list of all accounts in the new transaction:

<blockquote><pre class="one">
username=&gt; <b>commit;</b>
COMMIT
username=&gt; <b>begin;</b>
BEGIN
username=&gt; <b>select * from accounts;</b>
...
</pre></blockquote>

What output do you get?  Is it different than the output you received in
exercise 6?  Why or why not?

<p>
Now, let's try to modify the same account from two different transactions.
In the first (blue) terminal, start a transaction and deposit $5 into Mike's
account:

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="one">
username=&gt; <b>begin;</b>
BEGIN
username=&gt; <b>update accounts set balance=balance+5 where username='mike';</b>
UPDATE 1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In the second (red) terminal, start a transaction and withdraw $10 from
Mike's account:

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="two">
username=&gt; <b>begin;</b>
BEGIN
username=&gt; <b>update accounts set balance=balance-10 where username='mike';</b>
UPDATE 1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>Exercise 8.</b>

What happens to the second update?  Why?

<p>
Let's try aborting a transaction: enter the <tt>ABORT</tt> command in the first
(blue) terminal, undoing the $5 deposit:

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="one">
username=&gt; <b>abort;</b>
ROLLBACK
username=&gt; 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>Exercise 9.</b>

What happens to the second (red) terminal's transaction?

<p>
<b>Exercise 10.</b>

If you now commit the transaction in the second terminal, what is the
resulting balance in Mike's account?

<p>
Now let's perform an atomic transfer of $15 from Ben to Alyssa, using two
<tt>UPDATE</tt> statements in a single transaction.  In the first (blue)
terminal, list the balances of all accounts.  Then start a transaction
and do a part of a transfer in the second (red) terminal:

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="two">
username=&gt; <b>begin;</b>
BEGIN
username=&gt; <b>update accounts set balance=balance-15 where username='bitdiddl';</b>
UPDATE 1
username=&gt; 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>Exercise 11.</b>

If you now look at the list of all account balances in the first (blue)
terminal, have the results changed compared to before you started the
transaction in the second (red) terminal?

<p>
<b>Exercise 12.</b>

Finish the transfer by executing the following commands in the second
(red) terminal.  After each command, list all of the account balances
in the first (blue) terminal, to see at what point the effects of the
second terminal's transaction become visible.  What is that point, and
why?

<p>
<blockquote><pre class="two">
username=&gt; <b>update accounts set balance=balance+15 where username='alyssa';</b>
UPDATE 1
username=&gt; <b>commit;</b>
COMMIT
username=&gt; 
</pre></blockquote>

<h2>Transaction isolation levels</h2>

<p>
Postgres supports different transaction isolation levels.  So far, you
have been using <tt>SERIALIZABLE</tt> transactions, meaning that the
transactions appear to execute in some serial order.  Postgres also has
a <tt>READ COMMITTED</tt> isolation level, which allows one transaction
to immediately see the results of any other committed transaction; you
can read more about it in the Postgres manual
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/transaction-iso.html">here</a>.

<p>
<b>Exercise 13.</b>

By default, Postgres uses the <tt>READ COMMITTED</tt> isolation level
(and for all of the above exercises, we explicitly configured our Postgres
server to use the <tt>SERIALIZABLE</tt> isolation level instead).  Why do
you think Postgres developers chose to make the default isolation level
<tt>READ COMMITTED</tt>, which allows non-serializable schedules?

<p>
<b>Challenge exercise 14 (optional).</b>

Come up with two transactions that, when run concurrently (with some
interleaving of commands that you get to determine) produce a non-serializable
schedule.  That is, the result that you obtain should be impossible to produce
with <tt>SERIALIZABLE</tt> isolation, but is possible with <tt>READ COMMITTED</tt>.

<p>
To set the transaction isolation level to <tt>READ COMMITTED</tt>,
you can issue the following command:

<p>
<blockquote><pre>
username=&gt; <b>set session characteristics as transaction isolation level read committed;</b>
SET
username=&gt; 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Keep in mind that the effects of this command last for the duration of a
single session.  This means you have to issue it every time you re-start
<tt>psql</tt>, and issue it in <i>every</i> session of <tt>psql</tt>
that you start, to get <tt>READ COMMITTED</tt> isolation between your
transactions.
